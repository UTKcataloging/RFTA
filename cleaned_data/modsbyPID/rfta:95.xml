      <title>Interview with Mark Burnette, 2020-06-11</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Interview with Mark Burnette, a school psychologist with Sevier County Schools, conducted by Casey Kaufman. Burnette talks about the responsibilites in providing support to both students and faulty in the school system after the wildfires. Conducted over Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a representative quote from the interview: I can remember going to the environmental center, and I went to the classroom where the little girl that passed away, and I wanted to make sure they were good and they were. The teacher had her seat still available. They were all having honest conversation about the loss, and just how to support one another. That--that was the education part that was occurring still, more so than traditional means.</abstract>
