      <title>Interview with Lawrence Corley, 2020-05-15</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Video interview with Lawrence Corley of Builders for Christ, conducted by Casey Kaufman. Corley provides an overview of the organization before discussing how he was involved in the reconstruction of the Roaring Fork Baptist Church. Conducted over Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a representative quote from the interview: We're not seasoned workers, and so we do everything by code on purpose. And a guy like me, I would run around as an architect and I'll say, remember it's 2 nails and 2x4, 3 in a 2x6, 4 in a 2x8, and they laugh at me cause they get that lecture every year. But I want to make sure we do it by the code.</abstract>
